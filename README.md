# Smart Contract Portfolio

Welcome to my Smart Contract Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of smart contracts I have developed as side projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in blockchain development. Each project is designed to solve a specific problem or enhance functionality in the blockchain ecosystem. Below are the projects included in this repository:

## Projects

### 1. Rokit Marketplace

**Description**: An upgradeable NFT marketplace supporting both ERC721 and ERC1155 standards. It includes royalty management using ERP2981 and features an NFT launchpad to deploy ERC721 and ERC1155 collections with a single click.
